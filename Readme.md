CS375-1 LM4: Introduction to Interactive Flutter Applications
============================================================

## Objectives:
1. Make an interactive flutter calculator
2. Make your LM4 calculator interactive.  

## In Class Demos
We will demo your calculator in class at a future date.

## Grading Criteria:
| Criteria                           | Points Earned | Points Possible |
| -----------------------------------|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| Code Quality                       |               | 20              |
| Code Comments                      |               | 20              |
| Calculator works correctly         |               | 6               |
| Advanced feature                   |               | 4               |

## Requirements
You are only required to implement a simple interactive approach with two registers. However if you want the Advanced Feature points, you need to implement either a FSM controller OR a recursive descent parser of your own design. You can use the following two articles to help you design this aspect of the calculator. Remember to cite the articles or websites that you used in development inside your code!
1) Design a Finite State Machine controller for your calculator. (e.g. see this article https://medium.com/@rvunabandi/making-a-calculator-in-javascript-64193ea6a492 )
2) Design a calculator interpreter with a recursive descent parser and a grammar. (e.g. see this article http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~lacher/courses/COP4020/assigns/proj2a.html ) 

Do your best to write the layout code so that it's understandable, with good comments, but also as short as possible without using single letter variable (unless appropriate).

## Instructions:
1. Use git to clone this folder from Whitgit to a local machine. REMEMBER: Don't rely on storing this on a desktop in the computer science lab!
2. You must not share code electronically, you may however work with a classmate on solving the problems. If someone helps you solve a problem, or you find an answer online, you MUST cite the resource used. 
3. *REMEMBER*: It is a serious academic integrity violation to copy code electronically from other students or share your code electronically with another student! You may copy the instructors code for this exercise!
